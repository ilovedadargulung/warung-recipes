    <img src="../images/rendang.webp">
    <p>Rendang is a rich and flavorful Indonesian dish originating from the Minangkabau region in West Sumatra (Padang). 
        It's a slow-cooked dry curry deeply spiced with complex flavors. 
        Here's an original recipe for you to try.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Beef: 1 kg, cut into cubes (traditionally, beef is used, but you can also use chicken or mutton)</li>
        <li>Coconut Milk: 800 ml, from 2 coconuts (use canned if fresh is not available)</li>
        <li>Lemongrass: 2 stalks, bruised</li>
        <li>Kaffir Lime Leaves: 8-10</li>
        <li>Turmeric Leaf: 1 (optional, for aroma)</li>
        <li>Tamarind Juice: 2 tbsp</li>
        <li>Galangal: 4 cm piece</li>
        <li>Salt: To taste</li>
    </ul>
    <em>Spice Paste (blend the following):</em>
    <ul>
        <li>Shallots: 10</li>
        <li>Garlic: 6 cloves</li>
        <li>Red Chillies: 15 (adjust to your spice preference)</li>
        <li>Ginger: 5 cm piece</li>
        <li>Candlenuts: 5 (substitute with macadamia nuts if unavailable)</li>
        <li>Coriander Seeds: 1 tbsp</li>
        <li>Cumin Seeds: 1 tsp</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Spice Paste: 
            Blend the shallots, garlic, red chillies, ginger, candlenuts, coriander seeds, and cumin seeds in a food processor to form a smooth paste.</li>
        <li>Cook the Spice Paste: 
            In a large pot, cook the spice paste over medium heat until it becomes fragrant and its color deepens, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add the Beef: 
            Add the beef cubes to the pot and cook until they change color and are well-coated with the spice paste.
        </li>
        <li>Add Aromatics: 
            Add the bruised lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, turmeric leaf (if using), and galangal to the pot. Stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li>Pour in Coconut Milk: 
            Add the coconut milk and tamarind juice to the pot. Stir well.
        </li>
        <li>Slow Cook: 
            Bring the mixture to a simmer and then reduce the heat to low. Allow the rendang to cook slowly, uncovered, for about 3 to 4 hours. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. 
            The rendang is done when the meat is tender and the sauce has reduced to a thick, rich, dark brown paste.
        </li>
        <li>Season: Season with salt to taste towards the end of cooking.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve the rendang with steamed rice, preferably jasmine rice.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Patience is Key: Rendang benefits from slow cooking, which allows the flavors to develop and the meat to become tender.</li>
        <li>Stirring: Regular stirring is important, especially towards the end, to prevent burning as the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Coconut Milk Quality: The quality of the coconut milk significantly affects the taste. 
            Fresh coconut milk is ideal, but good quality canned milk can also work.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This recipe will give you a taste of authentic Padang-style rendang, rich in flavors and with a delightful complexity. 
        Enjoy your cooking!</p>
